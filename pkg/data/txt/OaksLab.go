Let me think...

Oh, that's right,
I told you to
come! Just wait!

Here, <PLAYER>!

There are 3
#MON here!

Haha!

They are inside
the # BALLs.

When I was young,
I was a serious
#MON trainer!

In my old age, I
have only 3 left,
but you can have
one! Choose!

have a request
of you two.

On the desk there
is my invention,
#DEX!

It automatically
records data on
#MON you've
seen or caught!

It's a hi-tech
encyclopedia!

Go ahead and
choose, ${PLAYER}!
